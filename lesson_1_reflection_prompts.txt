How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    

it`s help to see what changed in last time. Analyze last changes help to understand whot was wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

    

Saving entire history provice more safe of code changing. We have opportunity to back for one or more steps backward in our project.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?



Good for manual commiting: more logical clearly sequence for commits, more understanding for programmer.
Bad: not so clear for team working. Other programmers must undestend the logic of making commits of another team-workers.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    

Good idea. If I need it, i will put in repository a single file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    

"git log" command show all changes of files, ordered by time. "git diff" show the difference between two commits



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    

Because we always have a place to step back for one or more positions

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    

Don`t know. Lest see next lesson
