When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For safe my project, for sharing code to other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 

For prevent crash of project, if I make same changes which fall all the project in mess.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is operation to copy other repository to your own. 
Clone is copy repository from GitHub to local or from local to local.
Forking is not copying username of repository.
Branch is sequence of commits.
