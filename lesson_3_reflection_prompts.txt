When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For safe my project, for sharing code to other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 

For prevent crash of project, if I make same changes which fall all the project in mess.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is operation to copy other repository to your own. 
Clone is copy repository from GitHub to local or from local to local.
Forking is not copying username of repository.
Branch is sequence of commits.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Have a working code without any minute updates of another collaborations.
Can analyze changes witch make other.




How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  
What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

  

Without using Git we use same file directory such as network shared folder.
For differ version using different directory, time and data named.
More easier - more simple, it useful for small project with small numbers of coworkers.
Harder - make safe file in directory. 
Git always make an opportunity to step back, but if you rewrite file in folder it can`t be fixed.
